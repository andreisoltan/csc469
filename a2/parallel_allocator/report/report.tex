\section{Introduction}

Insert smart text here...

Restate the problem (multithreaded memory allocator). Mention the papers we
used (Hoard, Miser) and other resources. Describe (succicntly) the goal we are 
trying to achieve (speed, scalability, false sharing avoidance, low fragmentation). 
This is a sort of related works, in a way.

Describe the structure of the report. (i.e. section 1 - intro, etc.)

\newpage
\section{Allocator Design}

Insert smart text about the design of our allocator...

What metadata do we maintain? Why do we need it?
\begin{itemize}
	\item for the allocator
	\item for the heap(s)
	\item for he superblock(s)
	\item for the blocks inside the superblock
\end{itemize}

Where do we put the metadata? Why? (e.g. the structs for ht efree list at the 
end of the free memory block, because that makes it easier to merge to the 
right, where there is usally free memory. Just an example, not necessarily true.)

How do we handle rhe really large allocations?

Was there something we did to boost performance? (mention memory usage, 
processing, internal and external fragmentation (with no numbers?))

What other questions do we want to answer or design decisions that we think
are worth mentioning?

\newpage
\section{Design Alternatives}

Insert smart text about other features we considered for our allocator...

Was there something that would work better but is too hard to develop?

Was there something that was easier to develop but would give slightly slower
performance?

Was there something we tried, but found that it wouldn't work well (or took too 
much time/effort), and decided in favor of a simpler solution?

Was there something we did, avoided or fixed to have good performance?

Did we decided in favor or against something regarding fragmentation?

Should this a subsection of the Design section above?

\newpage
\section{Performance Analysis}

Insert smart text about how well our allocator performs...

\textbf{MUST HAVE} or we lose marks for not mentioning (from grading rubric)
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sequential Speed
	\item Scalability
	\item False Sharing Avoidance
	\item Fragmentation
\end{itemize}

Describe the experimental setup. (Subsection?)

Describe the performance measurements. \textbf{Must} have plenty of numbers 
(i.e. not "very few" according to rubric). (Subsection?)

Describe the memory usage, utilization, overhead, internal and external 
fragmentation. Pay significant attention to \textbf{fragmentation} and 
\textbf{usage}. Look at Hoard paper, performance section. 

\newpage
\section{Conclusion}

Insert smart text about how we did awesome... This might take work. :)

\newpage
\appendix
\section{References}

Cite the paper that we use, and any other resources. There is most likely another, better way to cite research stuff in \LaTeX{}.

\section{Tools}

Do we need this? Do we have something to write for this? (e.g scripts, programs, other tools, etc.)
