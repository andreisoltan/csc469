In order to run our experiments and generate report.pdf all that is required
is to execute run_experiment_A. The report (and most other output) will be
found in the log/ directory in subdirectories labelled with the host and PID
from whence they were generated. The most recently generated log directory will
always be symlinked at log/parta.latest

If you wish to generate any further data of your own, parta is where to get it.
Executing parta with no arguments will generate a usage message with details of
its invocation.

Should you wish to receive output in milliseconds rather than cycles, the
simplest method would be to use do-parta.sh. Run without any arguments it
will supply you with a usage message. In order to have it extract the current
frequency and pass it in to parta, use the -m flag.

run_experiment_A has some good example invocations of both the information
gathering tool, parta (and do-parta.sh), and also some examples of processing
the output.
