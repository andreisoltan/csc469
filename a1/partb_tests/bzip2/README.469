Instructions for running bzip2 with benchmark inputs...

The data/ directory contains the SPEC input data for three "sizes" of runs.
You are probably most interested in the train/input subdirectory. (test/ will be
too short for interesting measurements and ref/ will take too long).  The
all/input subdirectory contains two inputs that are used by each of the benchmark
"sizes", but with different settings for bzip2.

For example, the train/input/control file specifies three tests for bzip2.
If all the inputs are placed in the same directory with the executable, you
could run these as:

time ./bzip2-02 input.program 10
time ./bzip2-O2 byoudoin.jpg 5
time ./bzip2-02 input.combined 80

(And similarly for the bzip2-O3  versions)

The byoudoin.jpg file is found in the data/train/input/ directory, while the
other two input files are found in the data/all/input directory, originally.
