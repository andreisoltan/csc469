Instructions for running lbm with benchmark inputs...

The data/ directory contains the SPEC input data for three "sizes" of runs.
You are probably most interested in the train/input subdirectory. (test/ will be
too short for interesting measurements and ref/ will take too long). 

For example, data/train/input/lbm.in contains the command line arguments that
should be used with lbm.  For example, if you put the compiled binary and 
the input file "100_100_130_cf_b.of" (found in data/input/train/) in the 
same directory you would run it as:

time ./lbm-O2 300 reference.dat 0 1 100_100_130_cf_b.of

This is a long-running benchmark, but it is likely that you will see similar
trends with a reduced number of timesteps (e.g. 100 instead of 300)
