Instructions for running perlbench with benchmark inputs...

The data/ directory contains the SPEC input data for three "sizes" of runs.
You are probably most interested in the train/input subdirectory. (test/ will be
too short for interesting measurements and ref/ will take too long).  The
all/input subdirectory contains inputs that are used by each of the benchmark
"sizes", including some perl modules.

The *.in files in the data/<size>/input/ directory specify the inputs or 
arguments for the perl test programs.

To set up, you should combine the data/all/input/ directory with the 
data/train/input directory (in a new "run" directory). For diffmail.pl, 
splitmail.pl and perfect.pl, the corresponding .in file contains one uncommented line that should be used as the arguments to the perl program.

For example,
time perlbench-O2 diffmail.pl 2 550 15 24 23 100
time perlbench-O2 perfect.pl b 3

For scrabbl.pl, however, the scrabbl.in file is a list of words that should be provided via stdin. For example, 

time perlbench-O2 scrabbl.pl < scrabbl.in
