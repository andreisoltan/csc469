# We can get a list of the clock speeds of each processor on this system with
# the following command:
#       sed -n 's/cpu MHz[^:]*: //p' </proc/cpuinfo
# The nth line of output corresponds to the clock of processor #(n-1)

# TODO: Complete the shell script to:
#           - run the experiment & get data (should we do the average of multiple
#            runs or something?)           
# 			- run gnuplot (or replacement)
# 			- display the resulting graph (?)
